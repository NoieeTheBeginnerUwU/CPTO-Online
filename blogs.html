                <h1>Paracale, Town of <span style="color: gold;">Golden</span> Faith</h1>
                <p>
                    It was the day when the Miss Universe was held in Manila when we visited the town of Paracale. At first I was not excited at all. Honestly, my heart told me that I would rather watch the live telecast to see Maxine Medina gets the crown than to go somewhere else. But since I will be once again with the crew and host of MagTV na Oragon by ABS-CBN Regional Network Group, I decided to give it a try. It’s not always that I will be with these guys from ABS-CBN and relive my dream of being a real journalist.
<br><br>
Well, it turned out that even if Maxine won the Miss Universe crown, going to Paracale was the best decision I’ve made that day. I found out that it is more than just a mining town – that there were a lot of things that we can do here and discover.
<br><br>
We were lucky when we visited because it coincided with the week of the town fiesta and their annual “Pabirik Festival”. After our usual courtesy call to the town mayor, our first stop was the jewelry exhibit. Here all the entries for the annual jewelry design contest were exhibited. I was amazed by the size and artistry of the jewelries made of gold. Paracale has this unique jewelry design that is so detailed and intricate. It was really reflected in the various entries in this year’s competition.
<br><br>
We had our lunch at El Minero Restaurant near the Palanas Bridge. It was cozy place with native ambiance. We had our fill of Chop Suey, Pancit Canton and Buttered Chicken. The meal was really delectable but I was looking for a local delicacy like the “Humbang Paracale”.
<br><br>
We went to talk to the Barangay Captain of Poblacion, Hon Rio Paliza to know about the history and culture of Paracale. When we came to his office, I was amazed on how he patiently restored the old photographs of the people of Paracale. It was indeed a rare privilege to meet a person who not only love his culture and heritage but did something real about it. In other words, he walked the talk. For one he helped produce a coffee table book – Inay Candi: Bearer of the Light to inspire devotion to Inay Candi by young Paracaleños. He was one of the photographers of this coffee table book which was launched during the canonical coronation of Inay Candi as Patroness of CamNorte. He said that he too experienced a personal miracle from Inay Candi when his Dad recovered from a near death experience. His Dad told him that a woman cloth in blue and had a sword saved him. That miracle strengthened his faith and deepened his devotion to the Blessed Virgin of Candelaria.
<br><br>
Our next destination was a small jewelry shop that manufactures handcrafted gold jewelries. Here we observed how jewelries were made from gold wires. Paracale jewellers were highly skilled and devout craftsmen thus it became one of the important livelihoods of Paracaleños. Their intricate designs were inherited from their ancestors so this kind of skill needs to be preserved.
<br><br>
For our second day, we watched the Pabirik Festival’s Street Dancing Competition. There were 5 competing schools. All of them gave their best during the street parade and during the judges’ presentation. They showed different interpretations of the myth of Inay Candi and the pabirik or gold panning. In the end it was Paracale National High School who emerged as the champion in this year’s competition and got most of the minor awards including the Best Costume and Choreography.
<br><br>    
After lunch, we headed to Paracale Church for a rare privilege of seeing the original image of Inay Candi or the Nuestra Señora de Candelaria. Seeing the old and miraculous image of The Blessed Virgin Mary gave me goosebumps. It was mesmerizing and really touched my heart. Inay Candi is actually older than the image of Nuestra Señora de Peñafrancia of Naga City. The parish priest told us about the myth that keep the strong faith and devotion of Paracaleños  – that Inay Candi went down from the altar and fought the Moros invading the their land. I saw the hand of the image with a cut finger. It was believed that it was the proof of her fight with the Moros; that no matter how the parishioners tried to restore it the finger kept falling off so they let it that way. Maybe she wants it as a reminder of her love to Paracaleños. It is not the physical image that gave me the goosebumps but its strong presence that is beyond words and can only be felt.
<br><br>
For me, one of the must see heritage site in Paracale is the Nuestra Señora de Candelaria Church. It is one of the oldest Catholic churches in the Philippines. It is now more than 400 years old. I was amazed by the superb design of its retablo, the altarpiece. It was perfectly preserved that I cannot help but took a selfie and told my friends about it. I felt like I was in an old church somewhere in Spain of Portugal. The whole church was well preserved and taken care of by devoted Paracaleños.
<br><br>
Our third day was devoted to exploring the eco-tourism destinations of this town. With the help of councilor Amelia Oco, we were able to visit the beautiful island of Maculabo. We woke up early from our cozy room at Paliza del Rio Tourist Inn where we spent the night, then we headed to the island. We had our quick breakfast of hot pandesal on our way going to the fish port where our motorboat was waiting. It was still dawn when we boarded the motorboat. We saw the sun just appearing in the horizon when the boat headed to the island. It was around 6pm. The ride was quite bumpy but exciting and not dangerous. It was just enough to sustain our excitement and sense of adventure.
<br><br>
We circled the whole island to get the thorough view and saw the beautiful rock formations. We landed to the beach after one hour. We excitedly unloaded the motorboat and felt the white sand on our feet. I can’t help but gave in and swam in the clear blue water to my heart’s content. Well, technically it was not a swim because I just dipped myself and got wet while running away from the waves. I really enjoyed every minute of it and what really made my day was when I saw a rainbow between the island and the sea which was so awesome. What I found unique in this island was the presence of white coral rocks which complemented its white sand beach. After more selfies and jumpshots we headed back to the mainland.
<br><br>
After a short rest at Paliza del Rio Hotel we headed to Pulang Daga Beach Resort. This time we don’t need to travel by boat just to enjoy a fantastic semi-white sand beach. It was just near downtown of Paracale and can be easily reached by any land vehicle because the road is now cemented. The view was spectacular. There were beautiful cottages that can be rented if you want to stay overnight.  The water here was calm and perfect for swimming or just relaxing in the sand. Most of the time, it was not crowded unlike other beaches so you can just unwind and commune with nature.
<br><br>
Finally we watched the fluvial procession. It was raining but even that cannot stop the deep and strong devotion of Paracaleños to Inay Candi. At that moment they were united in paying homage to their Patroness.
<br><br>
As much as I wanted to put Paracale, the Town of Gold in the title I cannot comprehend why inspite of its vast resources mainly in gold is the hard truth that it is still a 3rd class municipality. Maybe the real treasure of this town is not gold but their faith – their faith in God and in themselves. From what I saw from our 3 day exploration, it is better for them to slowly transform their town into a tourism site, protect their environment and become an agricultural/fishery town. If mining is really helping them, then the town should be rich by now because it was ages ago when they started exploiting their gold and mineral deposits. Where do all these gold go? Who really benefited from them? Maybe it is time for a different approach. I hope that Inay Candi will lead them to what really matters in life.
<br><br>
So I say let’s help them. Let’s go and visit Paracale. Explore this town so we can transform it into Pilgrimage and Heritage, Farm Tourism and eco-adventure site. “Parto na sa Paracale”

                <h5>FEBRUARY 16, 2017 BY <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BADAGUASFATIMAYAHOOCOM</span></h5><br><br>
                <h1>San Lorenzo Ruiz, More than the Usual Adventure</h1>
                <p>
                    Now that San Lorenzo Ruiz has the Matacong Zipline; the longest zipline in Bicol Region, what’s next? After my zipline what can I do next? Where can I go? This is what I found out during my two day adventure exploration of this town with the hosts and crew of Mag-TV na Oragon, by ABS-CBN a regional network station. I was fortunate enough to visit more than the usual destinations that it has to offer. It all started with our challenging trek going to the beautiful Nacali Falls. 16736125_10212077220908630_848803048_n.jpgWe started at 9:00 AM and reached the falls at 11:30 AM. Right, it was two and a half hour walk but that is not the normal pace because we shot videos and interviews along the way. The normal length of trek is just about one and a half hour. For me it is not the length of the trek that matters but it is our mindset during the trek. We have to think that no matter what the situation or our condition we will enjoy the journey. That’s exactly what I did. I took a shot of every interesting subject along our way. I had to stopped from time to time to shoot pineapple plantations, coconut farm, giant ferns, carabaos, copra hut to name a few. We met some coconut farmers and they were kind enough to grant us a short interview and a photo shoot. They even offered us had some fresh buko and coco water too.


I don’t want to think about the destination at first because I wanted it to be a surprise. The trek required stamina especially when the trail is uphill or downhill. They were not that steep but still required great care and focus. It also required proper trekking outfit that covers and   protects you from sun and humidity.
<br><br>
When we reached the falls I felt so happy. It was so beautiful and almost untouched. I didn’t get a chance to swim but just staring at it and taking photos was enough to amaze me. The water was very clear that you can literally drink from it, which I did by the way. It tasted so fresh and immediately quenched my thirst. I took a video of it and it was breathtaking. It was like I’m inside a big green cave of canopy composed of giant ferns and thick vegetation. The falls was like this giant white curtain hanging from its wall. I can’t help but to imagine that there were even some water fairies and elves in the background.
<br><br>
The hike going back was shorter, thanks to the new Matacong Zipline. It was even easier than I expected because a coconut farmer passed by riding his cart before we reached the zipline. We asked him nicely if we can have a ride. He gave us his sweetest smile and a nod. We then hurriedly rode the cart and had our selfies. It was quite a bumpy ride but it is where the thrill and excitement come. It took me back to my childhood days in an instant. My recollection was abruptly stopped when the carabao halted because we reached the zipline station. After that exciting ride here is another more adventurous ride that we had to take if we want to save around 30 min of walking in an uphill terrain. I opted for the zipline. My zipline going back was just like passing to a hanging bridge but a hundred times faster and much more adrenaline rush. Before I knew it I was already on the other side. I felt tired but happy with my experience.
<br><br>
We headed to the nearest restaurant “Clarkniks” for our late lunch. It was a small native restaurant that serves local favorites like Bicol Express, Laing and Sinantol. The food was delicious and really satisfied our craving for unique flavors.
<br><br>
After our lunch we paid a visit to local church and met the Parish Priest. He was generous enough to sit down for a brief interview. The church itself was unique from the architectural design up to its interior. I was amazed by the simplicity of its altar. There was no elaborate retablo in the background. It was just a big black stone and a narrow pedestal where a small image of Jesus on the cross was located at its center with a tapered backdrop of stained glass image of Christ. The priest said that the big black stone altar was brought to the church from the mountain by the people of San Lorenzo Ruiz. It was a testament to the unity and strong faith of the people from this town.
<br><br>
During our second day we visited the Boyuboy Integrated Development Association (BIDA) and Women and Families of San Lorenzo Ruiz Association (WFSLRA). Both of t16780230_10212077219668599_419443987_n.jpghem develop products from pineapple like wine, juice and vinegar. The Queen Pineapple or Formosa variety is the sweetest pineapple that is grown abundantly here in San Lorenzo Ruiz. These women organizations are committed to provide livelihood and create products that will fully utilize the Queen Pineapple. We tasted their pineapple wine and vinegar and they really have the potential to become world class products that this town can be known for.
<br><br>
We had our snack of “Kalu-ko”. A native delicacy made of bunor, also known as Bungkokan or San Fernando a type of local rootcrop similar to taro. The flesh of bunor was scraped and mixed with sugar then it was returned to the hollow portion and cooked in thick coconut cream. It tasted good with coconut cream. The only thing is that there is only a limit to what you can eat because it feels so heavy in the stomach.
<br><br>
After that heavy snack, we headed to SLR Highland Park. It was a resettlement area and a biodiversity camp of DENR. It was also the highest point of Barangay Matacong. High enough to see the low lying areas of CamNorte like Daet and Mercedes. I felt like I was in Sagada or Tagaytay because of the cold wind and fog that greeted us. It was a quiet village with a covered court, a school and a small DSWD office. To my surprise they had electricity and abundant clean drinking water. It may be quite isolated but I think it is the best place if you want to relax and enjoy simple rural living.
<br><br>
Making a soft broom called “walis tambo” is the main livelihood of the people there. The men are the one who plant the Tiger grass locally known as tambo in Tagalog which produce the panicle or the soft fiber that shoots out like flowers from the grass. It is the main material in making the soft broom. The women are the one who makes the walis tambo. According to the residents their income from this industry is enough to sustain a family. Though the harvest is seasonal they can reserve portion of their harvest for the rainy days.
<br><br>
For the final stop we went to Dagotdotan River Resort. It was a slow flowing river where everyone can safely swim even the children. The general entrance fee was surprisingly cheap at 2Php only but it does not include the cottage rent. It was complete with basic amenities. We were greeted happily by the locals who excitedly did selfies with our celebrity TV hosts after they shot the last segment.
<br><br>
We left San Lorenzo Ruiz with a smile on our faces.  We had the complete adventure of our lives. It may not be that extreme but we really had a great time. It was more than the usual relief from the stress of city life. But more than the place, it is the people who made a great impression to us. We are thankful to the people of San Lorenzo Ruiz for giving us the wonderful glimpse of a barrio life and the happiness of simple living in a well preserved natural environment.
<br><br>
But don’t just take my word for it. Give it a try and visit San Lorenzo Ruiz!

            <h1>My Best Zipline Experience Ever!</h1>
            <p>
                I survived my first zipline experience but I still have this fear for trying another one. Not that I didn’t enjoy it. I just have this paranoia about safety. I do not have a fear of heights but I worry about my safety – period. What if things go wrong? What are the odds that I will still survive and enjoy the ride?
<br><br>
I think that human instinct encourages us to try dangerous things if we see that a lot of people are doing it. If they seem to enjoy and we hear positive things about their experience then our fears and doubts melted. Same thing happened to me when I muster the courage to try the newly opened Matacong Zipline in San Lorenzo Ruiz. I didn’t ride the first time because I have doubts about its safety. I was just finally convinced when I came back after almost a month because I saw the joy and excitement in the people’s faces after their ride.
<br><br>
Then I just found myself already signed my name in the waiver form. Then the zipline staff asked me what position I want. At first I answered the regular position which is the standing up. Then it hit me, why not try the superman? That way I can really experience how to fly. I changed my mind and opted for the superman instead.

<br><br>

Being the perfectionist that I am, I ask the staff to double check all my harness. After he double checked he let me go and glided my way through. I felt like my soul separated from my body in an astral projection thing like in Dr. Strange movie. That it tries to catch up with my physical body. My glide is not that fast during the first half so I really had time to enjoy the beautiful scene that I traversed. I passed through a thick coconut vegetation and a beautiful river. Then before I reached the other side I felt the fear for my safety. I fear that my harness will open and that I will drop dead before I even reached the end. Then I stopped a little bit short before the other side. The staff came to me and pulled me to the other end.
<br><br>
Then we had a short hike going up to the flat form of zipline going back. I told the staff that I am worried about the buckle of my harness. He told me not to worry because even if it gave way there is another one that can protect me. They assured me that all parts of the harness has double lock.
<br><br>
During my glide going back, it was faster than the first. This time I really enjoyed it because I fully trust the harness. I am confident that nothing will go wrong. I also screamed to release the joy and excitement that I felt during the ride. I never had that adrenaline rush in a long time. It really felt good as if all my tensions were released.
<br><br>
I learned that to enjoy the zipline ride we need to let go of our fear and be confident. At Matacong Zipline I was able to conquer that fear. Now I knew from experience that trust is the opposite of fear. When we trust that things will be ok then we let go of fear. We appreciate and enjoy the experience. The same is true in real life. That is why my Matacong zipline is my best zipline ever.

            <h1>Mother <span style=" background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.89); color: rgb(85, 29, 2); background-color: rgba(12, 211, 12, 0.463);">Tree</span>, A Giant In Real Life</h1>
            <p>
                I have never seen a real giant in my life so I was excited to see the “mother tree” which is the oldest and the largest tree in Bicol Region. We need to trek for one hour going there from the highway because it is more than two kilometers away. That did not stop me from meeting this giant. There is already an established trail which is cement

                Biggest Tree in Region V
                ed but it is just about one third of the total distance. The remaining half kilometer is long a trail under a thick forest.
                <br><br>
                The jump off site going to m
                other tree is located at Bicol Natural Park, Maharlika Hi-way, Sitio Nalisan, Barangay Tuaca, Basud, Camarines Norte.
                <br><br>
                I must say that the road is not an easy trek. It is a flat trail but there is series of uphill and downhill slopes although not that steep. It’s good that I wore soft jeans and closed shoes or else I might have some cuts from occasional thorny vines. Wearing shorts is not advisable.
                <br><br>
                We reached a cemented viewing deck but sad to say that the iron stairs were no longer there so we were not able to climb it. Then finally we reached the resting place which is a concrete open structure with tables and benches. Our guide told us that it was built by DENR together with the viewing deck.
                <br><br>
                We trek the remaining half kilometer of muddy and quite slippery trail until we finally reached the majestic “mother tree”. It is a Red Lauan Tree (shorea negrosensis). It stands 27 meters tall and has a base diameter of 2.06 meter. It is approximately 250-300
                years old.
                <br><br>
                Beside it is a small stream with cool and clean fresh water. We drank from it and refilled our water bottles. Then we took turns in taking selfie with mother tree. It’s really worth the time and effort we spent in coming there. I was in awe and feel goose bumps when I look up this majestic tree. I felt like Jack looking up to a giant beanstalk.
                It is my first time to see such an enormous tree where I imagine the treetop will reach the sky and a giant will come down from it anytime.
                <br><br>
                I was lost for words then I remembered the poem of Joyce Kilmer entitled “Trees”. This lovely poem captured what’s in my heart at that moment and it goes like this:
                <br><br><br><br>
                I think that I shall never see
                A poem lovely as a tree.
                <br><br>
                A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
                Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
                <br><br>
                A tree that looks at God all day,
                And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
                <br><br>
                A tree that may in summer wear
                A nest of robins in her hair;
                <br><br>
                Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
                Who intimately lives with rain.
                <br><br>
                Poems are made by fools like me,
                But only God can make a tree.
                <br><br>
                14686274_10210802826809574_1459814359_n
                <br><br>
                After we had our fill of the water from the stream and series of selfies/modeling with the mother tree we decided to trek back to the highway. We were really tired and hungry when we arrived. We went to the nearby Bahi River Resort to take our lunch
                
                <br><br>
                
                It was really one of my best treks so far but it needs strength and stamina to visit the mother tree. It is an
                experience/achievement worthy to be proud of but don’t take my word for it. You need to experience it yourself. It is not for
                everyone though. It is only recommended for those who are physically fit to enjoy nature and trekking. A proper gear and attire should also be observed like wearing trek shoes and light clothes.
                <br><br>
                And by the way before you pack your bag to see the giant here are some pointers:
                <br><br>
                You should visit the DENR office first at Bicol natural Park and meet the forest ranger assigned.
                Listen to the briefing to know the Do’s and Don’ts.
                Request for a guide.
                Register in the logbook so that in case you got lost or did not come back for some reason they know that you were there and can rescue you.

            <h1>Dragon Fruit Farm, Now In Cam Norte</h1><br><br>
            <p>
                Who would have thought that there will be a Dragon Fruit Farm in Brgy. Tuaca, Basud, Camarines Norte. Thanks to Jayarchelle Integrated Organic Farm, now not only delicious Dragon Fruit is within reach but it is also healthier because it is purely organic. That means no pesticides of chemicals were used in its production. In fact the farm is on its way to get certified as organic farm.

                <br><br>
They have different varieties of Dragon Fruit like the red, yellow and white flesh. We are fortunate to taste the red variety and we were not disappointed. It is delicious with just the right amount of sweetness.
<br><br>

Dragon fruit has many health benefits like decreasing bad cholesterol level, anti-cancer property and high in fiber for good digestion.
<br><br>
The farm is very accessible. It is just near the highway. You will be amaze by the breathtaking view of the Dragon Fruit trees overlooking the Mt. Susong Dalaga. It has  around 1.6 hectare of its land dedicated to Dragon Fruit and the remaining 4.4 hectares are for grapes, vegetables and fruit bearing trees like Mangosteen, Rambutan and Lanzones.
<br><br>
They now started to breed farm animals like wild pigs, turkeys and ducks. They also have a small strain of non stinging bees called “kiyot” for cross-pollination.
<br><br>
They plan to open the farm to public soon after they prepared all the amenities needed to make the guests comfortable. But now since the dragon fruit are bearing fruits, they started to sell them for 150 pesos per kilo. They just set up a small table along the highway and sell it there. A hundred kilos can easily finish in minutes. Some harvest around one hundreds are also brought to Manila and sold to the friends of the owner.
<br><br>
Jayarchelle Integrated Organic Farm has a great potential to become good example of Farm Tourism that can be started in Camarines Norte. Farm owners should take advantage of the opportunities in this endeavor now that strong typhoon doesn’t hit the province so often unlike before where trees are usually brought down before they even bear fruits. This will not only bring tourists to the province but will also promote health and wellness.

        <div class="panel">
          <section>
            <h5>SEPTEMBER 26, 2016 BY <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BADAGUASFATIMAYAHOOCOM</span></h5><br><br>
            <h1>More Than Just A Pilgrim Town</h1>
            <p><br><br>
                I grew up not knowing anything about Capalonga except that it is the home of the miraculous Black Nazarene. As a matter of fact I just visited it twice. The
re is an impression that it is a sleepy town that just comes alive during its three day fiesta celebration. Who could blame me? It is a far flung town from the highway that you need to
travel for hours just to be there. For a long time the road going there is very rough and bumpy so it will take half a day of travel. There was even a joke that when a pregnant woman travels to that road she will deliver her baby before she could even get to reach the hospital.
<br><br>
Is it going to stay that way? Are they willing to be just a pilgrim town forever?
<br><br>
We were surprised when we visited Capalonga recently for tourism site validation. Now it only takes two hours to reach it from Daet. It was a smooth ride because the road is cemented all the way through the downtown proper.  Mr. Rod Rawat the Tourism Officer and Councilor Fatima Oliva gave us a warm welcome. They became our tour guides and showed us their plans of how to transform Capalonga into a tourist destination.

<br><br>
We first paid homage to the Black Nazarene. Rod then showed us the Bay Walk and the reclamation area. Now they have a large covered court which can be used for mass gatherings and sports activities. The tourism office is nearly completed as well as the souvenir shops. He also told us the various infrastructure projects that already started thru BUB or Bottom Up Budgeting. Upon completion, these projects were aimed to make the town more accessible.

<br><br>
After our lunch at the mayor’s office, Rod took us to Palong Beach. It is a long stretch of rocky shore with cozy and relax atmosphere. Then we went uphill to visit the Shrine of the Black Nazarene which is under construction. It is facing the Talagpucao Fish

<br><br>
Port and Eco-Tourism and Adventure Park. From the top of the hill we saw several beaches which are accessible like the Albino Beach, Palong Beach and Gaite Rock. These are just along the highway before reaching the town proper.
<br><br>
After taking “selfies” from the top of the hill we went down to Talagpucao Fish Port and Eco-Tourism

<br><br>
Park where we saw the zipline. We noticed that the Eco-Adventure Park and the Fish Port do not complement each other. These should not be situated side by side because they have different functions. They need to find a better place suited for the fish port if they want Talagpucao area to become a tourism paradise.
<br><br>
The presence of mangrove forest in Talagpucao can be developed as tourist attraction especially when Rod mentioned to us the presence of “Tamilok” and “Sea Urchin”. Tamilok looks like a wood worm but it is in fact a kind of mollusk that inhabits the mangrove trees. It is a rare delicacy for tourists. Some say that it tastes better than oyster and is considered as an aphrodisiac. It is just a matter of building a mangrove walk and offer tamilok eating as a challenge just like what they do in “Bakhawan Ecopark in kalibo, Aklan.
<br><br>
Before going home we ate our snacks at Mommy’s Bulalohan, a small restaurant just along the highway near the Talagpucao Eco Park. To my surprise Mommy, the owner as people call her provided us with cold towels to freshen us. It is not a usual gesture but I really appreciate it. It shows how good the people of Capalonga welcome their guests. However, it is not their “Bulalo” that got me but their delicious pizza. It is full of cheese and toppings that will surely satisfies one’s craving. We can’t help but taking “selfies” with the pizza and Mommy.
<br><br>
Aside from the places we visited, other must see wonders are:

1. Banca-banca Falls in Sitio Cabibirok, Barangay Alayao
2. Itok Falls in Barangay Itok
3. Banokbok Falls in Barangay Alayao
4. Alayao River in Barangay Magsaysay
5. Itok River in Barangay Itok
6. Pulong Guijanlo (Island) in Barangay Camagsaan
7. Sabong-sabong Reef and Dive Site
8. Mount Samat
9. Lom-oc Beach in Barangay Camagsaan
10. Sabang Beach in Barangay Camagsaan
<br><br>
With proper mindset and tourism awareness, these beautiful natural spots can be a source of pride and livelihood for the people of Capalonga.  The Government and private sector needs to cooperate and prepare the locals in welcoming the tourists. The town has already an advantage because of the pilgrims. The challenge now is to offer more activities such as banana boat ride, zipline, rock/wall climbing etc. so that they will stay to explore the town further. Perhaps developing the local cuisine and making native delicacies available like their famous mud crabs will also be a wise move.
<br><br>
This town has a lot of potential when it comes to eco-tourism. It is blessed with beautiful natural wonders that need to be enjoyed and shared with the rest of the world. They already began their journey to achieve that. They are on the right track because they will start with series of Tourism Awareness Seminars with the help of Provincial Tourism Office. This will prepare the mindset of all stakeholders about tourism and environmental protection. They may have a long way to go but every journey begins with the first step.
<br><br>
So folks let’s join them in their first step … Let’s GO! Visit Capalonga!
